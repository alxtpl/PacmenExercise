# PacmenExercise

## Description

PacmenExercise is a simple web application inspired by the classic Pac-Man game. It allows users to control multiple Pac-Men characters using arrow keys to navigate through a maze and consume pellets. The project demonstrates basic JavaScript programming concepts and provides an entertaining interactive experience for users.

## How to Run

To run the PacmenExercise project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the Pac-Men characters. The Pac-Men will move across the screen, eating pellets as they go.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- Implement additional levels with increasing difficulty.
- Add ghosts as obstacles for the Pac-Men characters.
- Include a scoring system and timer to track performance.
- Improve the visual design and add animations for better user experience.
